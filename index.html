<div id="column" style="border-radius: 25px;">
<p>
Hello and welcome to my laboratory, my name is <b>Espirrador</b>, and I'm a scientist just like my older brother <a href="/petlookup.phtml?pet=_suco_">Suco</a>! Our species comes from a very far corner of the galaxy, to be more precise, I just mean we came from one of the craters of Kreludor, I guess it's not such a far corner when you think of it, hum? But it doesn't matter! If he can have a fancy lab and create thing so can I... right?
</p>
<p>Well, even if this lab thing doesn't work, at least I got to a few adventures around Neopia! That's what really matters! (I think...)
</p>

<h2>Our crater in Kreludor</h2>
<div id="left" style="border-radius: 25px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XznPOTf.png"></div>
<p>I'm very happy you are interested to know where I come from!
Anyway, like I said, me and my brother come from a small community of aishas that live in a Kreludor crater, which crater you ask?</p>
<p>Well, we know it as <b>Zorth 091</b>, but you neopians might have a different name for it, I don't know. In any case, that was our home, a very close community made up of... well... it might sound weird but, we were all farmers, I know... not as exciting as you though, right?</p>
<p>But the both of us did our best to study the starts and planets, dreaming of one day being able to travel and meet new creatures! Sometimes we would even venture out and talk to some of the warehouse grundos in the <b>Kreludor base</b>, they told us so many cool stories about Neopia and how many different creatures they've seen while working there...</p>
<p>In any case, we grew up there until a few years back, when the both of us decided to explore other planets with a small team of scientists, at the time it all seemed very nice and fun, but that's not exactly all of it... </p>

<h2>The space adventure</h2>
<div id="right" style="border-radius: 25px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aF4aFoS.png"></div>

<p>As soon as we boarded the spaceship I was extremely excited! We had finally started the adventures of our lives, the one we had been dreaming since we where kids! But things didn't really go as smoothly, my brother was always more intelligent than me, so as soon as he found a place to work while traveling he left the ship.</p>
<p>So I stayed behind... as a janitor... they didn't really value me for my intelligence since, well, I'm not as smart as my brother, but I do know quite a bit, might I let you know!</p>
<p>Doesn't really matter at the moment, but that's when my life changed a bit, while cleaning one of the labs on the ship I saw a very... weird little green blob, but something was wrong, it seems sad and somehow it ask me for food so I went to the kitchen and got a few food bars (which I always thought tasted really good!), but as soon as I tried to give it the bars the blob jumped on my arm!</p>
<p>It hurt quite a lot so I ended up blacking out, but I did hear the whole thing from one of the medics. He said the blob had started to consume my flesh, but somehow it didn't end me at all, in reality it just... made me like this! Yeah... you can kind of see my bones... and it feels like I'm made of jelly, but it's actually really cool!</p>

<h2>Now a days</h2>

<div id="left" style="border-radius: 25px;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/82fo8Vs.png"></div>
<p>Now we get to the more exciting part! After a few more light years in the spaceship exploring and seeing some different worlds with some weird creatures (might I add) we finally came down into <b>Neopia</b>, where I found my forever home to study all the creatures by Abyss's side!</p>
<p>As a weird creature themselves, they decided to give me and my brother a place to stay, and a place to have our labs! While my brother is experimenting with creating life I want to study the life that already exist in the world, which basically means all of the extraordinary creatures of Neopia.</p>
<p>But... because my body is quite weird, most other creatures (even of my own species) don't really like talking to me, so instead I just... watch them from afar (I know that's not the best, but... what can I do, right?).</p>
I'm in the lookout for friends as well since I have none in this planet, but I have made quite a few while staying with Abyss, like Goofy Bot! He's a robot created to clean, we always talk about my adventures while cleaning in space, and how horrible it is to try and drain liquid with no gravity.
<p>More adventures are still to come (with some friends... I hope), so I do hope you stay around to see more!</p>
